# Home Assistant – Systemair Modbus (SAVE)

**Norsk** · [Les på norsk](README.no.md)

[![HACS](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-green.svg)](https://hacs.xyz/)

This is a **Home Assistant integration for Systemair SAVE air handling units**
with support for **Modbus TCP**.

The integration provides structured monitoring and control of the ventilation
system in Home Assistant, with a focus on **correct airflow, energy-efficient
operation, and stable entity handling**.

⚠️ **Notice:**  
This is an **unofficial community project** and is **not developed, supported,
or maintained by Systemair**.

## 📋 Systemair SAVE – supported models

**Airflow estimation (m³/h)** is only available for models that are explicitly defined in the code and share the expected Modbus register layout.

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Yes / available  
- ⚙️ = Supported, but not tested  
- ❌ = Not available  

> ⚠️ Note: Older units with **CD4 controller** may use a different Modbus register map than units with **SAVE Touch**.  
> These units are not fully verified yet and may require adjustments. Please open an Issue if you test such a unit.

> Have you tested the integration with a model that is not marked as tested?  
> Please let me know by opening an Issue so this list can be updated.

## 🏗️ Prerequisites – unit selection and airflow

This integration assumes that the ventilation system is **properly designed
and correctly dimensioned**.

- The air handling unit must be selected based on actual airflow requirements (m³/h)
- Airflows per zone must be correctly balanced and commissioned
- Home Assistant does **not** replace professional ventilation design

The integration builds on the unit’s existing configuration and provides:
- monitoring
- control
- automation

Incorrect unit selection or airflow configuration cannot be compensated for by software.

The image below shows an example Lovelace card built manually in Home Assistant
using entities provided by this integration.

> The card itself is **not included** and can be freely customized to suit your setup.

## 📦 Installation (HACS)

### Requirements
- Home Assistant **2024.6** or newer
- Systemair SAVE unit with Modbus access
- Modbus TCP  
  - Built-in to the unit **or**
  - Via an external gateway (e.g. Elfin EW11)
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

---

### Method 1: Install via HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS**
2. Go to **Integrations**
3. Search for **Systemair Modbus**
4. Click **Download**
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add integration**
7. Select **Systemair Modbus** and enter:
   - IP address
   - Port (usually `502`)
   - Modbus slave ID

---

### Method 2: Install as a custom repository (manual)

> This method is mainly intended for development, testing, or early access to changes.

1. Open **HACS**
2. Go to **Integrations**
3. Open the menu (three dots) → **Custom repositories**
4. Add this repository as an **Integration**
5. Install **Systemair Modbus**
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add integration**
8. Select **Systemair Modbus** and enter:
   - IP address
   - Port (usually `502`)
   - Modbus slave ID

---

## ℹ️ Limitations and technical notes

- **Pressure Guard** is an internal safety function of the unit  
  → exposed as status only (read-only)
- Not all SAVE models support full stop via Modbus  
  → where full stop is unavailable, the lowest possible fan speed is used
- Available features depend on unit model and configuration

## 🔌 Physical installation – Elfin EW11 (Modbus RTU → TCP)

This section is only relevant if the unit does **not** have built-in Modbus TCP.

### ⚠️ WARNING
Always disconnect power to the air handling unit before opening it.  
If unsure, contact a qualified professional.

### 1. Modbus connection on Systemair SAVE
Locate the external communication terminals on the main control board:
- `A (+)`
- `B (–)`
- `24V`
- `GND`

![Example wiring diagram (VTR-500)](image/koblingsskjemaVTR-500.png)

### 2. Connect the Elfin EW11
Wire the connections according to the diagram below:

![EW11 wiring diagram](image/koblings%20skjema%20EW11.png)

---

### 3. Configure the Elfin EW11

1. Connect to the Wi-Fi network `EW1x_...` (open network)
2. Open the web interface: `http://10.10.100.254`
3. Log in with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
4. Go to **System Settings → WiFi Settings**
   - Set **WiFi Mode** to `STA`
   - Connect to your local network
5. Restart the device and assign a **static IP**
6. Open **Serial Port Settings** and configure as shown:

![Serial Port Settings EW11](image/serial%20port%20settings%20EW11.png)

7. Open **Communication Settings** and add a Modbus profile:

![Communication Settings EW11](image/communication%20settings%20EW11.png)

8. Under **Status**, packet counters should increase:

![EW11 communication status](image/kommunikasjon%20EW11.png)

Once communication is confirmed, the IP address can be used directly in Home Assistant.
