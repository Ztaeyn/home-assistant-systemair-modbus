# Home Assistant – Systemair Modbus (SAVE)

This is a **Home Assistant integration for Systemair SAVE air handling units**
with support for **Modbus TCP**.

The integration provides structured monitoring and control of the ventilation
system in Home Assistant, with a focus on **correct airflow, energy-efficient
operation, and stable entity handling**.

⚠️ **Notice:**  
This is an **unofficial community project** and is **not developed, supported,
or maintained by Systemair**.

---

## 🏗️ Prerequisites – unit selection and airflow

This integration assumes that the ventilation system is **properly designed
and correctly dimensioned**.

- The air handling unit must be selected based on actual airflow requirements (m³/h)
- Airflows per zone must be correctly balanced and commissioned
- Home Assistant does **not** replace professional ventilation design

The integration builds on the unit’s existing configuration and provides:
- monitoring
- control
- automation

Incorrect unit selection or airflow configuration cannot be compensated for by software.

- Display of actual operation based on the unit’s configuration
- Temperatures (outdoor, supply air, extract air, reheater, etc.)
- Fan speeds and operating status
- Heat recovery
- Filter status and alarms

### Energy efficiency
- **Eco mode**
- Demand-controlled ventilation (where supported by the unit)
- Away and Holiday modes
- Energy-efficient operation based on load and unit configuration

### Comfort
- **Free cooling** when conditions are met
- Party and Boost modes
- Manual fan speed control (Low / Normal / High)

### User experience
- Norwegian and English language support (follows Home Assistant language)
- Consistent and stable entities
- Built-in **buttons** for common actions
- Robust handling of temporary Modbus connection loss

## 📦 Installation (HACS)

### Requirements
- Home Assistant **2024.6** or newer
- Systemair SAVE unit with Modbus access
- Modbus TCP  
  - Built-in to the unit **or**
  - Via an external gateway (e.g. Elfin EW11)
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

### Installing the integration
1. Go to **HACS → Integrations**
2. Select **Custom repositories**
3. Add this repository as an **Integration**
4. Install **Systemair Modbus**
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add integration**
7. Select **Systemair Modbus** and enter:
   - IP address
   - Port (usually `502`)
   - Modbus slave ID

---

## ℹ️ Limitations and technical notes

- **Pressure Guard** is an internal safety function of the unit  
  → exposed as status only (read-only)
- Not all SAVE models support full stop via Modbus  
  → where full stop is unavailable, the lowest possible fan speed is used
- Available features depend on unit model and configuration

## 🔌 Physical installation – Elfin EW11 (Modbus RTU → TCP)

This section is only relevant if the unit does **not** have built-in Modbus TCP.

### ⚠️ WARNING
Always disconnect power to the air handling unit before opening it.  
If unsure, contact a qualified professional.

### 1. Modbus connection on Systemair SAVE
Locate the external communication terminals on the main control board:
- `A (+)`
- `B (–)`
- `24V`
- `GND`

### 2. Connect the Elfin EW11
Wire the connections according to the diagram below:

---

### 3. Configure the Elfin EW11

1. Connect to the Wi-Fi network `EW1x_...` (open network)
2. Open the web interface: `http://10.10.100.254`
3. Log in with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
4. Go to **System Settings → WiFi Settings**
   - Set **WiFi Mode** to `STA`
   - Connect to your local network
5. Restart the device and assign a **static IP**
6. Open **Serial Port Settings** and configure as shown:

![Serial Port Settings EW11](image/serial%20port%20settings%20EW11.png)

7. Open **Communication Settings** and add a Modbus profile:

![Communication Settings EW11](image/communication%20settings%20EW11.png)

8. Under **Status**, packet counters should increase:
